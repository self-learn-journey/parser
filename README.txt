This is a Scala-based Spring Boot application that exposes an HTTP endpoint to process incoming requests.

1)The application inspects the request headers and dynamically routes each request to the appropriate mapper.
2)Each mapper is responsible for:
   a) Parsing and validating the request body
   b) Performing field mapping based on business requirements
   c)Applying any required transformations or enrichment
3)The processed result is then returned as a structured HTTP response to the caller.

This design enables a flexible, modular approach where multiple request types can be handled seamlessly with minimal changes to the core service.
